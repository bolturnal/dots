## dotfiles:

- hyprland
- kitty
- neofetch
- nvim
- mako
- rofi
- waybar
- zsh

**NOTE:** _I'M WORKING ON IT_

## Installation:

**REQUIREMENT:** GNU Stow, `stow`... install it first!

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bolturnal/dots.git
```

**NOTE:**
This needs to be in `$HOME`... (`/home/username/` a.k.a. `~`)
And if you feel like it's cluttering home directory:
Hide it or rename it if you want to... before jumping on to the next step!!!

```
mv dots .dots # to hide it
mv dots [newName] # anything you want
```

Now,

```
stow [configName] # you gotta do it one by one
```
